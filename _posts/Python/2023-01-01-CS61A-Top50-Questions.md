| what is object?                                                   | Objects represent  information,** consisting of data and behavior** which are bundled together to create abstractions. <br>Objects can represent things, but also properties, interactions, & processes. <br>**In Python, every value is an object.** All objects have attributes, and a lot of data manipulation happens through object methods. Every object has three fundamental components: its id, its data type, and its value.<br> A useful metaphor here is to view an object as a box: the object’s id and type are like labels printed on the box, and the value is some piece of data that’s stored inside the box. In the past when we’ve talked about “values” in a Python program, we’ve really been talking about “objects that contain values”. And when we’ve talked about the data type of a particular value, we’re really been talking about the data type of the object that contains the value.

| Object mutation | In Python, object mutation (often shortened to just mutation) is an operation that changes the value of an existing object.  The id and type of object cannot be changed after the object is created, but the thing contained in the box --its values-- can.

| * Difference between variable reassignment and object mutation | For example,  we have `my_list = [1, 2, 3]`, `my_list = my_list + [4]` is variable reassginment, while `my_list.append(4)` is object mutation. The object mutation version was “faster” because it didn’t need to create a copy of the new list.

| Which data types are mutable or immutable? | 1. Data types int, float, bool, str, and collection data type tuple are all immutable. * For example, if we have an int object with value 3, that object’s value will always be 3. But remember, a variable that refers to this object might be reassigned to a different object later. This is why is is important that we **differentiate between variables and objects**.  * Immutable values are protected from mutation. * An immutable sequence may still change if it contains a mutable value as an element.<br>2. The collection data types set, list, and dict are mutable.<br>3. Data classes are mutable by default.

| Why some data types are immutable? | By choosing to make some data types immutable, the Python programming language designers are then able to simplify the code for handling those data types in the Python interpreter, and in doing so make the remaining non-mutating operations less error-prone and more efficient.

| Disadvantages of mutation | 1. Introducing mutation makes our code harder to reason about, as we need to track all changes to variable values line by line. 2. Mutable Default Arguments are Dangerous(Because a default argument value is part of a function value, not generated by a call)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Mutability, Objects                  | lab06 | |

| what is generator? | A generator **is an iterator** created automatically by calling a generator function. <br>A generator function is a function that yields values instead of returning them. When a generator function is called, it returns a generator that iterates over its yields. <br> Generators can `yield from` iterators or iterables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Generators                           | hw05| |
|How to evaluate a dot expression`<expression>.<name>` of objects? | 1. Evaluate the <expression> to the left of the dot, which yields the object of the dot expression<br>2. <name> is matched against the instance attributes of that object; if an attribute with that name exists, its value is returned<br>3. If not, <name> is looked up in the class, which yields a class attribute value<br>4. That value is returned unless it is a function, in which case a bound method is returned instead                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Objects                              | lab07, hw06 | |

| What is parsing? | The task of parsing a language involves coercing a string representation of an expression to the expression itself(which means a Parser takes text and returns an expression). <br> The parsing process consists of lexical analysis and syntactiv analysis. <br>  Lexical analysis: <br>* Iterative process <br>* Checks for malformed tokens <br>* Determines types of tokens  <br>* Processes one line at a time <br> Syntactic analysis: <br>* Tree-recursive process<br>* Balances parentheses<br>* Returns tree structure<br>* Processes multiple lines | Calculator, Interpreters             | lab11 | Scheme|
| Read-Eval-Print Loop of interpreter | The user interface for many programming languages is an interactive interpreter<br>1. Print a prompt<br>2. Read text input from the user<br>3. Parse the text input into an expression<br>4. Evaluate the expression<br>5. If any errors occur, report those errors, otherwise<br>6. Print the value of the expression and repeat | Calculator, Interpreters             | lab11 | Scheme|
| How to implement the "Eval" step? | Base cases:<br>• Primitive values (numbers)<br>• Look up values bound to symbols <br>Recursive calls:<br>• Eval(operator, operands) of call expressions<br>• Apply(procedure, arguments)<br>• Eval(sub-expressions) of special forms| Interpreter                          | | Scheme|
|How to implement the "Apply" step during "Eval"? | Base cases:<br>• Built-in primitive procedures<br>Recursive calls:<br>• Eval(body) of user-defined procedures | Interpreter                          | | Scheme|
| What are functional programming? | 1. All functions are pure functions<br>2. No re-assignment and no mutable data types<br>3. Name-value bindings are permanent |                                      |||
|The advantage of tail call? | A call expression is not a tail call if more computation is still required in the calling procedure. <br>The return value of the tail call is the return value of the current procedure call. Therefore, tail calls shouldn't increase the environment size. | Tail calls                           | | |
| what are macros? | A macro is an operation performed on the source code of a program before evaluation.  Macros exist in many languages, but are easiest to define correctly in a language like Lisp.  | Macros                               | lab12, hw09 | |
| Evaluation procedure of a macro call expression | • Evaluate the operator sub-expression, which evaluates to a macro<br>• Call the macro procedure on the operand expressions without evaluating them first<br>• Evaluate the expression returned from the macro procedure| Macros                               | lab12, hw09 | |
