# Plan to become a hacker
Inspired by [Eric S. Raymond](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html)


## Language
* python
  * UCB CS61A
* C/C++

    Learn it, so you're able to know how to solve tricky problems during development.
    At the same time, it's not an efficient language to programming.
    ::
        If a language does too much for you, it may be simultaneously a good tool for production and a bad one for learning.                             --- by ESR
